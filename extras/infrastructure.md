# Infrastructure Guide

## Compute Resources

Lab members are provided with a desktop.
For rotation and undergraduate students, these machines may be shared.
For full time lab members, the operating system should be reinstalled when the member joins.
Large-scale computation and web hosting are performed via commercial cloud providers.
Please discuss your project's computing needs with Casey to best optimize resource usage.

## Accounts

We have accounts with a number of key services.
When a lab member joins, accounts should be created in:

- [Slack](https://slack.com)

In addition, lab members should have accounts with github.
These accounts should get added to our:

- [github team account](https://github.com/greenelab/) (Greenelab)

We use the CU Research Computing (CURC) HPC systems.
Instructions to get a CURC account can be found in the [CURC documentation](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/logging-in.html).

Additionally, you might need access to our PetaLibrary partition `/pl/active/cgreene-sc-hgsoc`. You can request access using this [form](https://colorado.service-now.com/req_portal?id=ucb_sc_rc_form) or by emailing CURC at `rc-help@colorado.edu`.
