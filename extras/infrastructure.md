# Infrastructure Guide

## Compute Resources

Lab members are provided with a desktop.
For rotation and undergraduate students, these machines may be shared.
For full time lab members, the operating system should be reinstalled when the member joins.
Large-scale computation and web hosting are performed via commercial cloud providers.
Please discuss your project's computing needs with Casey to best optimize resource usage.

## Accounts

We have accounts with a number of key services.
When a lab member joins, accounts should be created in:

- [Slack](https://slack.com)

In addition, lab members should have accounts with github.
These accounts should get added to our:

- [github team account](https://github.com/greenelab/) (Greenelab)
